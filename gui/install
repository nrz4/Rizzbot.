Chatbot : Demo (Instuctions)

For this project we decided to have a Chatbot (Rizzbot essentially) that
communicates with a user with romantic conversations and advice on relationships, 
for any person to ask and discuss with

Essentially for now the only library we have used in our application is the Bogue
library. Bogue allows a programmer to use a GUI and applications of it.

Beforehand, to ensure you have dune, tsdl, tsdl-image and tsdl-ttf, please input as well unto the terminal the following command:

opam install dune tsdl tsdl-image tsdl-ttf

To install Bogue:

1) For Mac/iOS users please go into your termial on your Mac and put in the following
command: 
opam install bogue

2) Afterwards please cd into the project once you have downloaded from the zip file and within the terminal while running
on VSCode please input the following:
dune build

3) Once down enter the command "make exe" and you will be able to run the Chatbot.

For Windows essentially run the first and second step in your Ubuntu terminal and then run the rest within VSCode.
